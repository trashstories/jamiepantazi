# Research

<div style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify">

Welcome to my portfolio of research and graphic design. My research goals have been focused on exposing systemic racism as feature, not a bug, in American societies from the first settler-colonialist to the present day. Patriarchal white supremacy is baked into the foundation of the systems that govern our lives; from criminal justice to social services, racist and sexist biases are inherent. In order to break down these oppressive structures, they must first be identified and understood.
